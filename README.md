# Versum Documentation
This is a public repository to encourage community support on improving the documentation on versum

Some of our other repositories are private for now, that might change in the future as we work towards a more stable and open platform.

## Develop
This docs repo uses [retype](https://retype.com/guides/getting-started/) to generate the documentation.

```
yarn global add retypeapp
retype watch
```
