# Slippage

Advanced swaps have a staggering price which changes as users buy new editions. That means if someone buys it before you while your transaction is in the mempool the price will no loger be valid and
your transaction will fail.

By adjusting the slippage you are sending a slightly higher value to the asking price. This slippage should cover your transaction in case someone else's transaction arrives first. Any excess send to the smart contracts will be returned once you receive the token.
