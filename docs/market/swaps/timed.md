## What is a Timed Swap?

A timed-limited swap allows you to create a fixed sales price for your token for a limited period, after which that price is no longer available. Buyers are incentivised to buy the token within the time limit to take advantage of a short buying opportunity.

You can sell tokens you have minted or tokens you have bought from other creators at a fixed price and a time limit before sales end. This is done using Versum's Timed Swap sales listing. When logged into Versum, navigate to the token you want to sell from your profile, then: 

1. Navigate to the token's Market tab
2. Click "Create Swap"

4. Enter the quantity of tokens to sell (if applicable)
5. Select the currency ("Tezos")
6. Enter the price
7. Enter the time in hours
8. Click Confirm
9. Confirm the swap in your Wallet

## How do I change the price or duration of my sales listing?

If there's no buyer, then the seller has to press the "Complete swap" button on the token page or their dashboard to remove it.
