We are using anonymous analytics to help us identify issues some users have been reporting.

Analytics help us identify which page the user was visiting and which button they click and if that button performed the expected functionality.

These analytics can be opted out by the users at any moment ( from Settings/General), however any error that happens while this setting is disabled will not be logged and we will not be able to identify issues ahead of time.

It is recommended to turn this feature on if you are experiencing issue, that will allow us to track the error and help debug what's causing it, once fixed you can turn it off again.
