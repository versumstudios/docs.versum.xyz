# Minting

## I'm a new user to Versum. Can I mint straight away?

In order to mint, you first need to be verified. This is a measure designed to help protect artists from copyminters. For more details, please view our [verification](verification.md) help pages.

## What type of tokens can I mint?

We regularly review which formats to include. For launch, we've opted for file types that are compatible cross-browser.

You are able to mint:

- images `(.png, jpg, .gif)`
- videos `(.mp4, .ogg)`
- audio `(.mp3, .wav)`
- vector `(.svg)`
- PDF `(.pdf)`
- 3D files `(.glb)`
- web
- generative tokens `(coming soon)`.
