# Boards

Boards are a list or gallery of tokens and they can be either private or public.
Public boards can be followed by anyone, while private boards are only visible to you.

With boards we welcome a new type of users: curators!

## Private

When you create a new board it is private by default. Use them to organize your collection, or to create a wish list, or take your time curating your board before making it public â€” anything you want.

## Public

Public boards can be followed by other users and they contribute towards your personalised feed. You can curate different types of boards such as photography boards, creative coding boards, monochrome boards, illustration boards, etc.
