# Boards

Boards are a list or gallery of tokens and they can be either private or public.
Public boards can be followed by anyone, while private boards are only visible to you.

With boards we welcome a new type of users: curators!

**_Private boards_**

When you create a new board it is private by default. Use them to organize your collection, or to create a wish list, or take your time curating your board before making it public â€” anything you want.

**_Public boards_**

Public boards can be followed by other users and they contribute towards your personalised feed. You can curate different types of boards such as photography boards, creative coding boards, monochrome boards, illustration boards, etc.

## Creating a board!

Boards can be created from two places: your profile or within a token detail page.

To add content to your boards you can simply open any token detail page and next to the "Like" button you now have a new "Save" button. Pressing Save will prompt a modal window where you can select which board(s) you want to add/remove the token to/from.
