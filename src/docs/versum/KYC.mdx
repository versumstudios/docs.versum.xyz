# KYC

KYC, which is short for "know your customer" as well as "know your client," is the process of verifying a customer's identity. It's most common with financial institutions and financial service businesses, including banks, stock brokers, and now cryptocurrency exchanges.

## How does it work

At versum we do not track or store any personal information. Instead we rely on third party services where you can add claims (twitter, discord, website, etc) and associate them to your wallet (Read more on verification [here](https://docs.versum.xyz/docs/versum/Verification)).

If your trading volume (total amount of buying and selling) on Versum exceeds `â‚¬15,000`, or about `US$17,000`, we will require you to also setup a KYC claim on [TezID](https://tezid.net/) so we're complying with [AML](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp)/[CFA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/combating-financing-terrorism-cft.asp) laws.

After you reach the trading volume threshold, a KYC warning will display on your Versum dashboard, and any sales will be held in escrow until you complete the KYC requirement with TezID. Upon completion you are able to withdraw your funds.
